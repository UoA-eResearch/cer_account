An affiliation not known to the database has been put into either the cluster
account request form or the change of details form as the affiliation of an
applicant.

Please check the following three fields for typos and, if appropriate, add them
to the project database:

Institution: __INSTITUTION__
Division:    __DIVISION__
Department:  __DEPARTMENT__

If you create a new institution record for this applicant, please also consider
adding the institution's code to the "academicInstitutionCodes" list in
grand_unified_user_creator. If you are unsure how to do this, please consult
a maintainer of the panadmin toolkit.

If there are typos, please correct the values in the profile of the researcher
who used this new affiliation, whether or not you create a new institution
record in the database.
